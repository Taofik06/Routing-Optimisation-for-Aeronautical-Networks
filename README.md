# Routing-Optimization-for-Aeronautical-Networks
Dijkstra and Extended Dijkstra Algorithm were used to solve real-world routing optimization problem for Aeronautical networks: single-objective and multiple-objectives optimization challenges of 216 airplanes trying to access internet from ground stations (Heathrow Airport (LHR) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)) while maximizing the end-to-end transmission rate and minimizing the end-to-end latency. This project is a group assessment of the Search and Optimization course module towards my postgraduate degree

OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS
There are two problems you should address:
1. Single-objective optimisation: Find a routing path having the maximum end-to-end data transmission rate for
each airplane that can access any of a GS, either at Heathrow airport (LHR) (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude) =
(51.4700° N, 0.4543° W, 81.73 feet) or Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude) =
(40.6895° N, 74.1745° W, 8.72 feet).
2. Multiple-objective optimisation: Find a routing path having the maximum end-to-end data transmission rate and
minimum end-to-end latency for each airplane that can access any of a GS, either at Heathrow airport (Latitude,
Longitude, Altitude) = (51.4700° N, 0.4543° W, 81.73 feet) or Newark Liberty International Airport (Latitude,
Longitude, Altitude) = (40.6895° N, 74.1745° W, 8.72 feet).
